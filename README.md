# Dual Wield - Reboot

Thanks to jedijosh920 for the <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/dual-wield">original mod</a>

Please credit him if you use this code for your project

A wise man used to say "Double the gun, Double the fun". That's why Dual Wield mod by Jedijosh is all we need, sadly it's outdated.   
I've decided to redo the script and make it slightly prettier with a few new features. 

No need to explain the features, basically this script will try to achieve what Max Payne Dual Wield system did, but limited to GTAV code capability
